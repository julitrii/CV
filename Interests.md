<p>My main research interests consist of implementing the tools I have learned for the development of projects around quantum information theory, specifically applying programming tools to this type of theory. Currently, I have knowledge about quantum correlations like Quantum Discord and Entanglement of Formation. In my master's, I worked theoretically and experimentally with topological phases in multiqubit systems. At present., I hope to implement the knowledge acquired through machine learning.</p>
