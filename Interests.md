My main research interests are the design and application of Quantum Optics systems and development at Quantum Information theory. At present I have knowledge about quantum correlations like Quantum Discord and Entanglement of Formation. In my master degree I am worked both theoretically and experimentally with topological phases in multiqubit systems. Currently I am learning programming with matching learning and management and analysis of databases. My future research plans are to exploit the studies carried out during my bachelor and master degree to overcome the challenges that have quantum optical systems and explore programming and data analysis tools to create new research projects.
