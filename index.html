<div>
<p style="text-align:justify"> I am a MSc on quantum information and quantum optics physics at 
  the Federal University of Minas Gerais (UFMG) and physicist at the Univeridad Nacional de Colombia
  with experience in investigation who combined studies with working and other commitments. Seeking opportunities to apply 
  the skills obtained through my career. I'm interested in software development. Aiming at combining background, research experience
  and skills. Strong knowledge on theoretical physics such as quantum mechanics, statistical mechanics, classical an quantum optics
  among others, and sufficient on programming on different languages such as Python andC++. Very good working in group as well as
  developing projects on my own. Particularly passionate about teaching. All without leaving aside daily activities that also 
  interest me like sports, chess, dance and meet new people.</p>
